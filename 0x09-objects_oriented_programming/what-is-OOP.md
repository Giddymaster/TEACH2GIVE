# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in JavaScript
OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects, which bundle data (properties) and behaviors (methods) together.
It promotes code reusability, modularity, and scalability.

## The key principles of OOP include:
- Encapsulation: Bundles data and methods within an object.

- Abstraction: Hides implementation details while exposing only necessary components

- Inheritance: Allows new objects to inherit properties and methods from existing ones. 

- Polymorphism: Enables different objects to implement the same method in varied ways.
